# FESOM-C
Coastal Ocean Model with quasi-B discretization (Androsov A., Fofonova V., Kuznetsov I., Harig S., Degregori E., K.H. Wiltshire)
FESOM-C solves 3D primitive equations in the Boussinesq, hydrostatic, and traditional approximations for the momentum, continuity, and density constituents, and it uses a terrain-following coordinate in the vertical. It has the cell vertex finite-volume discretization (quasi-B-grid) and works on any configurations of triangular, quadrangular, or hybrid meshes. The schemes to compute vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity can be chosen via the coupled General Ocean Turbulence Model developed in Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnem√ºnde (IOW). The numerical scheme of FESOM-C splits the fast and slow motions into barotropic and baroclinic subsystems. It uses an asynchronous time stepping, assuming that integration of temperature and salinity is half-step-shifted with respect to momentum. For modeling wetting and drying we use the relatively simple method proposed by Stelling and Duinmeijer, the algorithm to account for wetting and drying (if an appropriate flag is on) is performed on each time step of the external mode. Three schemes have been implemented in FESOM-C for horizontal advection: upwind, Miura, and MUSCL-type. The tracer advection schemes are running in combination with the FCT (flux-corrected transport) algorithm.
